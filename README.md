# taskday5 I have learned how to train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree using Graphviz, which helped me understand how the model makes decisions. I explored overfitting by adjusting the depth of the tree and controlling its complexity to improve generalization. Next, I trained a Random Forest and compared its accuracy with Decision Trees, recognizing how ensemble learning enhances predictive performance. Through feature importance analysis, I identified which variables had the most influence on the modelâ€™s output. Finally, I performed cross-validation, ensuring that my model generalizes well by evaluating its performance across multiple dataset splits. This journey has given me a strong understanding of tree-based models and ensemble methods, and I'm ready to explore hyperparameter tuning or advanced techniques to further refine my skills
